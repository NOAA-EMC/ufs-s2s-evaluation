**Step 0**
- Acquire data from HPSS: `Prep/get_exp.sh`. Must specify:    
-`exp_new` (ID for new exp)   
-`hpss_root` (location at HPSS)   
-`upload_root` (directory for uploading of 6-hourly grib files)
- Convert hourly grib files to a single file per IC with 35 daily values: `Prep/drive_preprocess.sh` (invokes `preprocess.sh`). Must specify:        
-`exp_new` (ID for new exp)   
-`upload_root` (directory with uploaded 6-hourly grib files)   
-`exp_root` (directory for storing netcdfs)

**Objective A** 

Plot the biases of two experiment runs for a set of ICs that is common to both. 
(the script automatically selects only dates that are in common, not necessary to specify)
Biases are calculated in reference to observations that have been previously prepared and reside in subdirectories within `obs_root=/scratch2/NCEPDEV/climate/Lydia.B.Stefanova/ReferenceData/`
- Produce maps of average bias and difference: `WithObs/Maps/drive_map_obs.sh` (invokes `map_compare_obs.sh`). Must specify:      
-`obs_root` (path to top of obs directory)   
-`exp_root` (path to top of exp directory)    
-`exp_old`  (ID for old exp)   
-`exp_new`  (ID for new exp)   

**Objective B**
- Produce line plots of area mean values, area mean bias, RMSE and bias-corrected RMSE: `WithObs/Lines/drive_anoms.sh` (invokes `anoms12.sh`)

**Note** that the scripts generate a number of ncl and txt files - if not interested in the contents, clean up manually.
Also note that `drive_map_obs.sh` and `drive_anoms.sh` expect 16-day long netcdf files with daily values from two experiments (exp1 and exp2) for various ICs (prepared in Step 0); The subdirectories for exp_old and exp_new are expected in a common directory (e.g. `/scratch2/NCEPDEV/climate/Lydia.B.Stefanova/Models/`).

**Parameters to be specified**

hardcopy (yes or no)  
obs_root (path to top of obs directory)  
exp_root (path to top of exp directory)   
exp_old  (ID for old exp)   
exp_new  (ID for new exp)   

**Parameters that can be modified if desired**
nplots (valid options are 1 or 3 for "WithoutObs", 3 or 9 for "WithObs/Maps")
varlist   
domain  
seasonlist  (valid entries for HR runs are DJF, JJA, AllAvailable)
d1, d2  (first and last day of the averaging period)
